# Governance, Authority and Assurance Metamodel

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.9.0-blue.svg)](VERSION)
[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-candidate%20specification-purple.svg)](releases/v0.9.0.md)
[![Validation](https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/governance-authority-assurance-metamodel/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/governance-authority-assurance-metamodel/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

GAAM specifies how digital and agentic systems represent and enforce **authority, delegation, revocation, evidence, assurance, trust decisions, effects, accountability, appeal and remedy**. It treats governance as an executable system property rather than a document-only control layer.

Version **0.9.0** is the **Candidate Specification**. Its normative surface, eight composable profiles, canonical schemas, governed vocabularies, behavioural test vectors, threat traceability and reproducible governance package are available for implementation and external review. Candidate status does not constitute certification or independent interoperability.

## Start here

- [Normative specification](specification/governance-authority-assurance-metamodel.md)
- [Architecture overview](docs/architecture-overview.md)
- [Implementation guide](docs/implementation-guide.md)
- [Conformance and assurance guide](docs/conformance-guide.md)
- [Profiles](profiles/index.md)
- [Schemas](schemas/index.md)
- [Threat model](threat-model/README.md)
- [Candidate stability policy](docs/candidate-stability-policy.md)
- [Migration from v0.5.0](docs/migration-v0.5.0-to-v0.9.0.md)
- [v0.9.0 release notes](releases/v0.9.0.md)

## Validate

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/validate.py
```

The validator produces `validation/validation-report.json`, `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, requirement coverage, threat traceability and package checksums. A passing run means the repository satisfies its publication, structural and included behavioural checks. It does not create an L4 independent-assessment claim.

## Source relationship

GAAM is an independent specification. The [Trust Systems Meta-Model](https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/trust-systems-meta-model) informed selected semantic analysis, documented in the [TSMM adoption crosswalk](mappings/tsmm-v0.22.0-adoption-crosswalk.md), without creating a normative dependency.
